# Hanasand agent rules

Fix the user's request completely, including root causes and nearby issues that make it broken, misleading, unusable, or unsafe. Leave optional improvements alone, but report these to the user.

Prefer deletion, reuse, plain language, and the minimal best practice complete fix. Verify the result once when useful, then stop when it works.

## Product language

- Write cases, case summaries and documentation in simple, natural language. State the problem and the next action. Say “Restore the replica from a backup,” not “Reseed the affected replica from a verified source before treating it as recovered.” Keep detailed evidence in the case and do not claim recovery before the failing check passes.
- Monitoring events must be collected in HA cases. Only the shared case sender may notify Discord, at most once per case and destination every 24 hours, including across restarts and recurrence.

- Implement the requested behavior. Do not answer the prompt inside the product with explanatory cards, banners, divs, capability lists, implementation summaries, or claims that a feature is real, not real, safe, unsafe, complete, uncomplete, working or not working.
- Keep implementation explanations and verification results in the task response. Prefer minimal UI text, and descriptive icons rather than text.
- Use short, natural labels and concrete language. Remove redundant introductions, repeated headings, development jargon, and test or acceptance terminology from display copy. Preserve necessary guidance, validation, permissions, and recorded audit data.
- When cleaning up copy, remove the unnecessary element rather than replacing it with another paragraph explaining the cleanup. Do not add tests that require filler text to exist.

Do not expand a small request into a redesign, new workflow, documentation exercise, or deployment ceremony unless the request requires it. Preserve unrelated work in a dirty tree. Never expose secrets or perform destructive actions without explicit scope.

Always work on main. Never create branches, commit, or push on Inspur or OVH. Make commits and pushes from a local development checkout, and update server checkouts only by fast-forwarding main from an upstream main. Keep application directories writable by their runtime processes; do not change their ownership or permissions to enforce this Git policy.

After completing and verifying requested changes, commit and push to both GitHub and Forgejo from a local development checkout, then redeploy the affected service. This is standing user authorization; do not ask for confirmation again for routine publication or deployment. Verify the deployed revision and affected live behavior before reporting completion.

## Completion responses

Make the final response self-contained so the user does not have to reread progress messages. Always include:

- A short recap of what the user requested, including later corrections.
- A clickable link to each affected live page so the user can check the result. For work without a page, link to the relevant repository file or commit instead; do not invent a page URL.
- A concise explanation of what changed and, for a fix, what caused the problem.
- Relevant verification, the commit hash, and confirmed push and deployment status. Name anything unfinished or blocked; never claim a release is deployed before checking it.

Keep routine progress updates brief and focused on meaningful findings or blockers. The final recap and links are required even after a long task. The standing requirement above to commit, push to both remotes, redeploy the affected service and verify it still applies.

## Automated checks and service accounts

Do not create timestamped monitor users or one-off production audit users. Reuse an existing service account with only the endpoints the task needs. On the hanasand server, protected `/home/hanasand/hanasand/ops/monitoring-state/service-accounts.env` contains `MONITOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (authentication health checks) and `HANASAND_DB_MONITOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (database UI monitoring). Load credentials locally on that server; never print keys, copy them into chat, or commit them. Use `X-API-Key` for API requests. A missing or insufficient scope is a configuration problem, not a reason to create a new user or grant administrator roles.

Service accounts are managed at `/management/service-accounts` or `GET/POST /api/service-accounts` and `DELETE /api/service-accounts/:id` with a system-administrator session. Creation accepts `{name, scopes: [{method, route}]}` and returns the key once. GET lists the supported endpoints. No wildcard permissions or human login sessions are granted. The database browser monitor can use its service key in a short-lived browser context; the frontend permits only GET/HEAD `/db` and the API still enforces endpoint scopes. Revoke unused accounts through the service-account API.
