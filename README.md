# Hanasand

Hanasand combines threat intelligence, AI development tools, and infrastructure management at [hanasand.com](https://hanasand.com). The public site and authenticated dashboard share a Next.js frontend and a Bun/Fastify API. PostgreSQL stores accounts and application data.

## Service map

| Component | Source | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | `frontend/` | Public pages, dashboard, AI editor, shared projects, articles, notes and thesis |
| API | `api/` | Authentication, organizations, permissions, billing, AI requests, project storage, infrastructure and public API |
| Threat intelligence | [TI repository](https://github.com/eirikhanasand/ti) | Source collection, parsing, search, alerts and monitoring; runs with a dedicated database |
| AI model client | `ops/ai-model-client/` | Connects an inference server to the API over WebSockets |
| Model runtime | `gpt/` | Model launch scripts and inference server code |
| Browser services | `ops/browser-worker/`, `ops/onion-tor/` | Isolated browser sessions, WebRTC transport and Tor access |
| Database | `db/`, `api/src/utils/db/` | Initial schema and application schema updates |
| Mail service | `mail/` | Stalwart configuration and persistent mail data |
| Mail client | [mail repository](https://github.com/eirikhanasand/mail) | Standalone webmail at `mail.hanasand.com`; mailbox data stays in the Hanasand API |
| Client apps | `app/` | Mobile and desktop clients; see [desktop setup](app/desktop/README.md) |
| Operations | `ops/`, `scripts/` | Deployment, backups, maintenance and service checks |

`docker-compose.yml` defines service connections, ports, volumes and health checks. OpenResty terminates public HTTPS outside this Compose project. The API also integrates with external VM hosts, password lookup and other configured services.

## Monitoring issues

External sensor hubs can submit incident, recovery and heartbeat events to an **External events** check. See [external monitoring](docs/external-monitoring.md) for the event schema, sender setup and mock.

All monitoring alerts, including replication, backups and failover, must go through HA cases. Never post individual events directly to Discord. Repeated events update the same case; only that case may notify Discord, once per destination every 24 hours. Recovery and recurrence do not reset that limit.

Each intelligence health check keeps the same case when its error changes, including connection failures. Collection, enrichment and delivery remain separate checks. When duplicate cases are merged, keep their old links, events, comments and notification history, and preserve the latest notification deadline.

The standby case reader uses the read-only grants in `db/standby-permissions.sql`. Keep case writes, VM passwords and repository secrets out of that role.

Recovery checks run every minute using `system:recovery` and the monitor's read-only state file. Run `bun scripts/setup-recovery-monitoring.ts` in the API worker to configure them with the existing Hanasand owner, organization and Discord destination. The independent recovery monitor keeps sampling and routing traffic; the API creates cases when it can reach the writable database.

A failed save must not turn a successful check into a service outage. Report the monitoring job's error without adding a false failure to the checked service's case.

Use simple, natural language in alerts, cases, UI text and documentation. Say what happened and what to do next. For example: “WAL replication lost. Restore the replica from a backup.” and “No backup taken in 36 hours.” Keep diagnostic details in the case. Do not say services have recovered while the case is still failing. See [copy style](docs/copy-style.md).

Health-check failures and slow responses are grouped by monitor, target and failure reason in `monitoring_issues`. Each has a stable `HA-<number>` reference, occurrence count, first/last seen times and recovery time. Check records link to the issue; recovery closes it, and recurrence reopens the same number. Details are returned by the authenticated `GET /api/automations/:id` endpoint and shown in the monitoring dashboard.

Discord receives `@everyone` and the case number, at most once per issue and destination every 24 hours. PostgreSQL reserves delivery before sending, so restarts and concurrent workers do not reset the limit. Failed or uncertain delivery is recorded in the issue and waits for the same 24-hour window before retrying. Monitoring results remain independent of notification delivery. These persisted records appear alongside other cases at `/cases`, with details at `/cases/HA-<number>`. The shared case page is independent of DWM and reports unavailable sources without hiding cases from the remaining sources. Existing `/dwm/cases` links redirect to `/cases`; old `MON-` links redirect to the corresponding `HA-` case.

## Agent task completion

Agents must finish requested changes by verifying them, committing, pushing to both GitHub and Forgejo, redeploying the affected service, and checking the deployed revision and live behavior. Routine publication and deployment have standing authorization.

Every final response must briefly recap the user's request, explain what changed, and include clickable links to the affected live pages so the user can check them. For work without a page, link to the relevant repository file or commit instead. Include the commit hash, relevant checks, and confirmed push/deployment status; clearly identify anything unfinished. The response must stand on its own without requiring the user to reread progress messages.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#completion-responses) for the repository-wide agent instructions.

## Development

Use Bun 1.3.11, Node.js 22 and Docker Compose. Install dependencies in the component you are changing with `bun install`.

The root `.env` is private and is not committed. Obtain a development configuration from the operator; never copy production credentials into tests. The API requires `DB_HOST`, `DB_PASSWORD` and `VM_API_TOKEN`. Also configure `DB`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PORT` for the development database. Match the frontend API URLs to that environment; several defaults point at production.

Run in separate terminals:

```sh
cd api
bun run start:local
```

```sh
cd frontend
bun run dev
```

The local API defaults to port 8080 and the frontend to 3000. A host process reaches the Compose database on port 8503; containers use `postgres:5432`. Use a separate development database. API startup applies schema updates and starts scheduled jobs, so do not point a development server at production.

## AI

`POST /api/tools/ai` handles AI requests. Common project requests can use built-in generators; other requests go to a connected model. `GET /api/ai/models` reports connected models. An empty list means inference is unavailable, even if the API and parser bridge are healthy.

The model client uses `HANASAND_AI_CLIENT_API_WS`, `HANASAND_AI_OPENAI_BASE` and `HANASAND_AI_MODEL`. Model launch scripts live in `gpt/`. Starting the client alone does not start an inference server.

Generated projects include source, a README, environment examples, build commands and Docker configuration. Website output includes its page, layout and CSS. These are starting points: API records and worker queues currently use in-memory state, and external integrations require implementation. A generated project or passing source check is not evidence that a production integration works.


### Host and JSON monitoring

`GET https://api.hanasand.com/api/metrics` requires an authenticated session and includes numeric host telemetry under `host`. The host collector (`scripts/host-metrics.ts`) samples every 15 seconds and writes an atomic file shared read-only with API workers. Install or update it on Inspur with `sudo sh scripts/install-host-metrics.sh`. After the API schema is ready, run `bun scripts/setup-host-monitoring.ts` in the API worker to add the six checks with the existing Discord destination. Re-running setup preserves configured checks. Snapshots older than 90 seconds are unavailable, never treated as healthy.

Health checks support JSON fields, comparisons and maximum/minimum/average/first-value aggregation. Dot paths support array wildcards, for example `host.storage.*.usedPercent`. Checks for the same owner, URL and request options share one response per minute, including errors. PostgreSQL locking prevents duplicate fetches across workers. Responses are limited to 1 MiB; obsolete cache entries expire. The administrator-only `system:metrics` source reads the same host payload locally, without storing a session credential.

Storage, RAM, CPU and GPU alert strictly above 80%. Temperature and power alert above `floor(reported hardware limit × 0.9)`; their `margin` is the alert limit minus the reading, so checks alert below zero. Missing limits stay null. Power covers reported CPU/GPU devices, not unmetered wall power. Separate checks keep their own history, case number and 24-hour Discord cooldown. Discord messages contain `@everyone HA-<number>`; accepted message IDs and mention status are recorded for delivery review.

### AI monitoring

- [Connected models](https://api.hanasand.com/api/ai/health/models): reports the current model connection count; HTTP 503 when none are connected.
- [Inference](https://api.hanasand.com/api/ai/health/inference): runs a small request through the production WebSocket path; HTTP 503 if it cannot complete. Results are shared for 30 seconds to limit probe traffic.

Both checks run every minute under Dashboard → Automation → Monitoring and use the existing Discord destination. `bun scripts/setup-ai-monitoring.ts` in `api/` configures them from the Hanasand API monitor without exposing its webhook. Failed availability checks keep running.

Monitoring history uses the actual stored check count, supports date filters, and loads older checks on scroll. Graph bars show recorded results; uptime is calculated from completed checks.

## Tests

Run the checks for the component you change:

```sh
cd api
bun run test
bun run lint
```

```sh
cd frontend
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run build
```

The API command runs the core checks and every unit test in `api/tests`, with each file in a separate process. Database, server, network and browser checks are opt-in through `api/scripts/index.ts`; run them against disposable services. The thesis database check also requires `THESIS_TEST_DATABASE=1`. Automation history requires `DB_HOST=monitor-test-db`; thesis storage requires `DB_HOST=thesis-test-db`.

Generated-project checks cover exported files, TypeScript, API validation and pagination, worker retries and cancellation, and honest website output. Run `bun run test --only=generated-builds` in `api/` to install each generated project's declared dependencies and build all four project types. This requires npm and package-registry access. Set `GENERATED_PROJECTS_DIR` to retain the builds.

The real website browser test is `frontend/tests/generated-website.spec.ts`. Point `GENERATED_WEBSITE_URL` at the generated website you started, then run that file with Playwright. It checks keyboard navigation, mobile layout, zoom, runtime errors and contact configuration. If the website was built with `CONTACT_EMAIL`, supply the same value as `GENERATED_WEBSITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` to the test.

The old share-chat story suites were removed: minimum file counts, required document phrases and test-authored preview pages did not verify generated application behavior.

The collector has its own `bun run test` and `bun run check` commands in the TI repository's `scraper/` directory.

## Production deployment

Host TypeScript utilities require Bun 1.3.13; install it for the host account with `scripts/install-typescript-runtime.sh` before enabling their systemd units.

Use `ssh inspur` and work from `/home/hanasand/hanasand`. Deploy only the changed component.

```sh
# Frontend: build, check, switch traffic, then remove the old container.
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Equivalent: make deploy
# Use an already tested image tagged hanasand:
./scripts/deploy.sh --no-build

# API: build and test before replacing the running container.
docker compose build api
docker compose up -d --no-deps --no-build api
```

Do not use a stack-wide `docker compose up --build`. Do not replace the frontend directly through Compose; use the script to avoid a gap in service. API replacement can briefly interrupt requests and WebSockets.

After deployment, check the affected page or endpoint, service logs and `docker compose ps`. The frontend alternates between ports 3000 and 3100, with OpenResty routing traffic to the active container. For rollback, retain the previous image ID and proxy configuration. Schema changes require a separate rollback plan; an image rollback does not reverse a migration.

## Data and operations

PostgreSQL, API state, prompt submissions and mail are persistent. `db/init.sql` initializes the application database; application schema updates run through `api/src/utils/db/ensureSchema.ts`. TI source records and evidence use the separate TI database and its repository migrations.

Database backups are configured through `DB_BACKUP_*` variables. Defaults schedule a daily backup and retain 14 days in the API state volume. Keep an independent copy and verify restoration; a backup on the same host does not cover host loss. TI backup tools are maintained in the TI repository. Do not delete volumes during deployment.

Start diagnosis with `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs --tail=100 <service>`. `/api/health` checks the API process; `/api/ai/models` checks model connections. Use the dashboard status page for collection, processing and dependency failures. A healthy container does not imply that its external dependencies work.

## Shared thesis

`/thesis` is public. Dashboard → Admin → Thesis opens the editor. Only account ID `eirikhanasand` can edit; permissions do not depend on its display name.

PostgreSQL stores the shared title and content. Edits autosave after five seconds and broadcast over `/api/ws/thesis`. Unchanged content causes no write. Leaving the page triggers a final save attempt; local recovery drafts cover interrupted delivery and browser request limits.

History keeps the previous version, 20-minute checkpoints for seven days, then up to three checkpoints per day. Stale concurrent writes require a choice of versions. Restoring a version preserves the text it replaces.

## Contributing

Follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [copy style](docs/copy-style.md). Keep changes focused, verify them, and push `main` to both Forgejo (`origin`) and GitHub (`github`). Do not include private configuration or credentials in commits or logs.

### Authentication releases

Authentication is deployed as part of the canonical full-stack release. Standalone recovery/auth replacement commands are intentionally removed; use `scripts/deploy-all.sh` so the API, frontend, and supporting services stay on one main revision.
